Welcome to chemutils!

This library is pretty straight-forward to use, requiring just three steps to use in your project!

Step #1: Generating the solution file.

First of all, you will need to download premake5, if you don't have it already.
After you have gotten it, run this command in the root directory(chemutils/):

	premake5 vs2022(or vs2019, or your VS version)

Afterwards, if the generation was successful, you should see a .sln file called "chemutils.sln".
Open it, and wait for the solution to load in Visual Studio.

Step #2: Building chemutils.

Once it's loaded in, you can select whether you want to build a Debug build or a Release build. (Release comes with optimizations, Debug comes with symbols and no optimizations.)
Afterwards, right-click on the project in the Solution Explorer and press Build(or Ctrl+(Shift)+B) and wait for it to compile.

Step #3: Using chemutils in your project.

After it has compiled, go to the directory build/bin, and there you can find the built library. Put that directory into your additional library directories,
and add the .lib file's full name(name+extension) into your additional dependencies. After you've done that, put the src/ folder into your additional include directories.


After you've done those three steps, you should be ready to use chemutils in your project!
